## 5. What is Node.js?

- Node.js ↔ is JavaScript on the server side, leveraged from usual JavaScript which is run in web browsers/client side.
- How can Node.js run JavaScript on the server-side? ↔ Node.js uses the V8 JavaScript engine to run all of the JavaScript code you provide.
    - Node.js is able to teach JavaScript new things by providing C++ bindings to V8.
    - This allows JavaScript in essence to do anything that C++ can do.
    - C++ can indeed access the file system so now JavaScript can access the file system through Node.js.
